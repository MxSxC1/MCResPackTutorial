**Minecraft Resource Pack Tutorial - Create A Resource Pack In <5 Minutes To Replace Gold Ore Texture**
[www.miscreat.co.uk](https://www.miscreat.co.uk/gaming/minecraft/mcreplacetexture)

This pack does nothing other than replacing the Minecraft gold ore image with itself. Net result - zero from a visual point of view. So what's the point? This is a Simple Resource Pack Template For Tutorial Purposes to show people how to create their own custom textures pack.

By replacing exactly 1 file (or replacing it in 2 places if you want it to look nice) you can replace the gold ore texture with anything you like:

1. Create a gold ore texture in .png format with a resolution of 64*64 (or multiple thereof). What does this mean? Create an image 64*64 with anything, replace it, and see how it looks. Then you can work out making it nice. . Use Gimp, though any editor will do. As always, this is simple, but there is more to it than that. Separate Tutorial Incoming For PBR Textures...with an example (pretty much the same as this with 2 extra files).

2. Download this structure and put it in your Minecraft Folder. It is usually here:
C:\Users\[USERNAME]\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\resourcepacks\

3.Replace these 2 files in the pack with your new texture.
  gold_ore.png
  pack.png (optional)
  Load The Pack
Done

4. If you have issues with "Invalid Version" then you need to increment the number 15 below in pack.mcmeta to latest version (google it or increment by 1 for next version usually). And you may as well rename it "description" while you're at it. And I'd rename the folder to the same. Don't use spaces in folder name, well I wouldn't anyway,  but you can in description)
    "pack_format": 15,
    "description": "MxSxC1GoldOre"
    
[MXSXC1 PROJECT WOLVERINE WARNING] 
Never blindly download and install code, mods, packs, anything...without reviewing and understanding it first! For packages, validate it, check the source, check certificates, look at checksums/MD5/whatever. If you don't understand it, don't run, and don't blindly run things as Adminstrator. 

This is a tutorial pack, to show people how simple it is to create a resource pack, based on the absolute minimum required. Don't take our word for it, check it. You can't get a more simple pack to check, and will take you 30 seconds. You do not want to copy complicated resource packs, as you don't know what else is hiding in them.
[MXSXC1 END OF WARNING NOBODY WILL READ]

This is the most basic, and an example, will do separate examples and videos/tutorials on how to do more, and find the names/textures/originals/export the jar file/etc...use Gimp, do PBR, etc (nowhere near as hard as made out, but it does take considerable skill and effort to get it right)

People over complicate things, me included, hopefully this is simpler. And as always, it is not really this simple in most cases! There is a lot more to it, but for now, that's you done, and works for basic textures...
