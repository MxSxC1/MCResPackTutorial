Minecraft Resource Pack Tutorial - Create A Resource Pack In <5 Minutes To Replace Gold Ore Texture
[www.miscreat.co.uk](https://www.miscreat.co.uk/gaming/minecraft/mcreplacetexture)

This pack does nothing other than replacing the Minecraft gold ore image with itself. Net result - zero from a visual point of view. 

Simple Resource Pack For Tutorial Purposes to show people how to create their own custom textures. This resource pack is the most basic, and does pretty much nothing. It replaces the gold ore texture, with the same.

However, combined with the tutorial, and replacing exactly 1 file (2 if you want it to look nice) you can replace the gold ore texture with anything you like within bounds below:

1. Create a gold ore texture in .png format with a resolution of 64*64 (or multiple thereof). Separate Tutorial Incoming If Need Help.

2. Download this structure and put it in your Minecraft Folder. It is usually here:
C:\Users\[USERNAME]\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\resourcepacks\

3.Replace these 2 files in the pack.
  gold_ore.png
  pack.png (optional)
  Load The Pack
Done

4. If you have issues with "Invalid Version" then you need to increment the number 13 below in pack.mcmeta to latest version (google it or increment by 1 for next version usually). And you may as well rename it "description" while you're at it. And I'd rename the folder to the same. Don't use spaces in folder name, well I wouldn't anyway,  but you can in descr.ption)
    "pack_format": 13,
    "description": "MxSxC1GoldOre"
    
[MXSXC1 PROJECT WOLVERINE WARNING] 
Never blindly download and install code, mods, packs, anything...without reviewing and understanding it first! For packages, validate it, check the source, check certificates, look at checksums/MD5/whatever. If you don't understand it, don't run, and don't blindly run things as Adminstrator. 

This is a tutorial pack, to show people how simple it is to create a resource pack, based on the absolute minimum required. Don't take our word for it, check it. You can't get a more simple pack to check, and will take you 30 secondws. You do not want to copy complicate resource packs, as you don't know what else is hiding in them.
[MXSXC1 END OF WARNING NOBODY WILL READ]

This is the most basic, and an example, will do separate examples and videos/tutorials on how to do more, and find the names/textures/originals/export the jar file/etc...use Gimp, do PBR, etc (nowhere near as hard as made out, but it does take considerable skill and effort to get it right)

People over complicate things, me included, hopefully this is simpler.
