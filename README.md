Minecraft Resource Pack Tutorial
[www.miscreat.co.uk](https://www.miscreat.co.uk/gaming/minecraft/mcreplacetexture)

Simple Resource Pack For Tutorial Purposes to show people how to create their own custom textures.

This resource pack is the most basic, and does pretty much nothing. It replaces the gold ore texture, with the same.

However, combined with the tutorial, and replacing exactly 1 file (2 if you want it to look nice) you can replace any texture in Minecraft.

People over complicate things.

Create a new gold_ore texture in .png format with a resolution of 64*64 (or multiple thereof). 
Replace these 2 files in the pack.
Load The Pack
Done
