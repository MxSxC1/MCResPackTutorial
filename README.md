**Minecraft Resource Pack Tutorial - Create A Resource Pack In <5 Minutes To Replace Gold Ore Texture**
[www.miscreat.co.uk](https://www.miscreat.co.uk/gaming/minecraft/mcreplacetexture)

This pack does nothing other than replacing the Minecraft gold ore image with...itself! Net result - zero, from a visual point of view. So what's the point? 

This is a Simple Resource Pack Template For Tutorial Purposes to show people how to create their own custom textures pack by replacing that image with their own.

By replacing exactly 1 file (or replacing it in 2 places if you want it to look nice) you can replace the gold ore texture with anything you like:

1. Create a gold ore texture in .png format with a resolution of 64 by 64 (or multiple thereof). What does this mean? Create an image 64 by 64 with anything you like, just try it, see how it looks. Then you can work out making it nice. I Use Gimp, which is free though any editor will do, even paint. As always, this is simple, but there is more to it than that to make it look good. Separate Tutorial Incoming For PBR Textures...with an example (pretty much the same as this with 2 extra files).

2. Download this structure and put it in your Minecraft Folder. It is usually here:
  C:\Users\[USERNAME]\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\resourcepacks\

3.Replace these 2 files in the pack with your new texture.

  gold_ore.png
  
  pack.png (optional)
  
4. Load The Pack
  
5. If you have issues with "Invalid Version" then you need to increment the number 22 below in pack.mcmeta to latest version (google it or increment by 1 for next version usually). And you may as well rename it "description" while you're at it. And I'd rename the folder to the same. Don't use spaces in folder name, well I wouldn't anyway,  but you can in description)
    "pack_format": 22,
    "description": "MxSxC1GoldOre"
    
[MXSXC1 PROJECT WOLVERINE WARNING] 
Never blindly download and install code, mods, packs, anything...without reviewing and understanding it first! For packages, validate it, check the source, check certificates, look at checksums/MD5/whatever. If you don't understand it, don't run, and don't blindly run things as Adminstrator. 

This is a tutorial pack, to show people how simple it is to create a resource pack, based on the absolute minimum required. Don't take our word for it, check it. You can't get a more simple pack to check, and will take you 30 seconds. You do not want to copy complicated resource packs, as you don't know what else is hiding in them.

[MXSXC1 END OF WARNING NOBODY WILL READ]

People over complicate things, me included, hopefully this is simpler. And as always, it is not really this simple to make it pretty and do it well, but the mechanics are simple.
