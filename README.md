Minecraft Resource Pack Tutorial
[www.miscreat.co.uk](https://www.miscreat.co.uk/gaming/minecraft/mcreplacetexture)

Simple Resource Pack For Tutorial Purposes to show people how to create their own custom textures. This resource pack is the most basic, and does pretty much nothing. It replaces the gold ore texture, with the same.

However, combined with the tutorial, and replacing exactly 1 file (2 if you want it to look nice) you can replace the gold ore texture with anything you like within bounds below:

Create a gole ore texture in .png format with a resolution of 64*64 (or multiple thereof). 
Replace these 2 files in the pack.
  gold_ore.png
  pack.png (optional)
  Load The Pack
Done

If you have issues with "Invalid Version" then you need to increment the number 13 below in pack.mcmeta to latest version (google it or increment by 1 for next version usually). And you may as well rename it "description" while you're at it.
    "pack_format": 13,
    "description": "MxSxC1Base"


This is the most basic, and an example, will do separate examples and videos/tutorials on how to do more, and find the names/textures/originals/export the jar file/etc...use Gimp, do PBR, etc (nowhere near as hard as made out, but it does take considerable skill and effort to get it right)

People over complicate things, me included, hopefully this is simpler.
